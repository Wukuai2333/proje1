**Usage**
This website basically has 4 functions: sign-up,login,logout and let users writing down her/his reviews or diaries in the home page.
Instead of building my own css file, I use Bootstrap CSS and Font Awesome CSS files. It is more convenient, powerful and time-saving.
This page mostly serves to let the user record her/his own thought. It can be used to record a diary, reading review or movie comment. The user can write down the title of the writing and the time and date she/he finish writing will also be recoreded and presented below the notes written.

**Functions Used**
This project utilize HTML, Python,WTForms, Jinja Templating, HTTP Requests(POST and GET), authentication, Flask SQLAlchemy, Foreign Key Relationships, etc.

**Note**
As I read through all the forms I can use by Bootstrap(https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/forms/) I found that there's a lot of forms that I can use to make the recording more fun and meaningful. For example, select class to let the recorder choose the mood when the notes is writtendown.  File inputs form to let the recorder upload photos or media files with the notes. However it is one hour before the deadline. I'll try using these forms for next lab.
